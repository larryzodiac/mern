Assessment: _develop a full web application stack using MongoDB, Express, React and Node (MERN)._

Site hosted with [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) @ [https://larryzodiac-mern.glitch.me/](https://larryzodiac-mern.glitch.me/).

# Introduction

This project is an attempt to mimic [Medium](https://medium.com/). An open publishing platform for writers around the world.

# User Stories

There are two types of users who use Medium. The first is a casual reader who browses and reads articles they enjoy; The second is a writer player who uses Medium as a platform for publishing their material.

Casual reader - conditions/satisfactions :

- As a casual reader, I want to browse _articles_, so that I can read them in my spare time.
- As a casual reader, I want to search for _articles_, so to better find reading material that interests me.

Writer - conditions/satisfactions :

- As a writer, I want to _create_ an account, so to _publish_ my material.
- As a writer, I want the option to _edit_ or _delte_ my material, if I'm not happy with it.

Broken down details :

- Provide list components for articles that readers may browse.
- Provide login/register functionality so writers may publish/store their material.
- Provide utility components that writers may use to update or delete articles.
- Provide navigation menus to travel between each section.

# Wireframe

Wireframe (pre-development) from stories depicts three pages :

- Home page
- Signin/Signup page
- Profile page

Each page will be wrapped within a number of top-level components that implement _React Router, React Context, MDC AppBar_ and _MDC Layout Grid._

# Application Description

The React application is composed of an _App.js, Index.js, Provider.js_ and a _components_ folder.

The components folder contains subfolders for each pageâ€™s components e.g `<Home/>` and `<Profile/>` and a collection of miscellaneous components for modular use e.g `<Text/>` form field and `<Article/>` viewing components.

Provider.js acts as a wrapper at top-level for React context. It defines a `<Context.Provider/>` component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.

App.js contains the top-level wrapper components mentioned above. It is where the page components are imported and rendered based on browser URLs and using [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy).

Index.js imports App.js and appends the application to the DOM.

### App.js

The primary function of `<App/>` is to keep track of whether a user is logged in or not, and if so, to store the user id.

App.js achieves this by holding a `setLoginSuccess()` function and `logout()` function. These are passed down to child components who's job it is to handle login/register operations.

On top of this, when App.js is mounted to the DOM, it makes an initial axios request to `/api/token` that checks for the existence of any web tokens from recently logged in users and sets login status accordingly.

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  // Who goes there? Where is your token? ðŸ‘®
  axios.get('/api/token')
    .then((response) => {
      if (response.status === 200) {
        this.setState({
          loginSuccess: true,
          id: response.data,
        });
      }
    })
    .catch(() => this.setState({ loginSuccess: false }));
}
```

If successful, this state id data is passed as a _prop_ to the `<Provider/>` component so to expose the user's id to any level of the application.

Lastly, App.js is responsible for holding `<AppBar/>`, `<BrowserRouter/>` and `<Grid/>` components for a site navigation, declarative routing and grid systems respectively.

Pseudo-code:

```javascript
class App {

  <Provider>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <AppBar />
      <TopAppBarFixedAdjust>
        <Grid>
          <Switch>
            <Route component={Home} />
            <Route component={Profile} />
            // ...More awesome pages
          </Switch>
        </Grid>
      </TopAppBarFixedAdjust>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </Provider>

}

export App;
```

### AppBar.js

The `<AppBar/>` component exists solely to cut down the size of `<App/>`. It utilises [Material Design Components(MDC) React](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-react)â€™s `<TopAppBar/>` component for site navigation.

_AppBar.js_ accepts a single boolean prop from _App.js_ indicating if a user is logged in or not. A conditional will render either icons to indicate login/register or logout.

### Provider.js

As mentioned, the `<Provider/>` component acts as a top-level wrapper component for React's Context API.

_Provider.js_ is a functional component that returns a context _provider_ component based on an initialised context. Inside this component is rendered `{props.children}` which enables other components down the tree to access the provider(at the top-level).

To access this data we must use what is known as a _Consumer_ in our other components.

```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
// ...
<MyContext.Provider>
  { props.children }
</MyContext.Provider>
// ... ->
<MyContext.Consumer />
```

Now, whereever a consumer is rendered, a respective component will have access to context.

The context provider also takes a value prop which passes down the context:

```javascript
<MyContext.Provider
  value={{
    globalUserId,
    // ...
  }}
>
  { props.children }
</MyContext.Provider>
```

This is especially useful as we want the user's id to be accessible throughout the application for conditional UI rendering and in Express request parametres.

### Article.js

The `<Article/>` component is used in both `<Home/>` and `<Profile/>` page components as both render a list of articles.

_Article.js'_ primary function is to provide users a link to an article, or provide _edit_ or _delete_ options for logged in users. Specifically, on a user's own _articles._

_Article.js_ uses React's _Context API_ to achieve this.

Previously mentioned in _App.js_, if a user is logged in, their id is passed as a prop to the `<Provider/>` wrapper component. The id is defined as `globaUserId` and is accessible throughout the application.

Note, when an `<Article/>` is rendered, both it's `id` and the `userId` are passed as props:

```javascript
<Article
  id={a._id}
  userId={a.user_id}
  // ...
/>
```

Context is invoked to access `globalUserId` in `<Article/>` by importing the context and specifying class `contextType`:

```javascript
import { MyContext } from '../../Provider';

class Article extends Component {
  static contextType = MyContext;
  // ...
  const { globalUserId } = this.context;
  // ...
}
```

Then a condition checking if the article's `userId` matches the `globalUserId` is specified in render:

```javascript
if (globalUserId === userId) {
  articleOptions = (
    <MyContext.Consumer /> //...
  );
} else {
  articleOptions = <React.Fragment />;
}
```

Therefore, if a user is logged and their id is specified in context as `globalUserId`, _and_, any article's `userId` props match it; a user may see rendered both _edit_ and _delete_ options for a respective `<Article/>` component.

The update opperation is a React Router link to a route with an optional id parametre:

```javascript
<Link to={`/publish/${id}`}>
  <IconButton /> //...
</Link>
```

The delete operation is stored in context and is accessed the same way as before except via a callback:

```javascript
articleOptions = (
  <MyContext.Consumer>
    {context => (
      <React.Fragment>
        <Link to={`/publish/${id}`}>
          <IconButton />
        </Link>
        <IconButton onClick={() => context.handleArticleDelete(id, getArticles)} />
      </React.Fragment>
    )}
  </MyContext.Consumer>
);
```

```javascript
<div>
  <Link to={`/article/${id}`}>
    <Headline4>{ title }</Headline4>
    <Body2>{ blurb }</Body2>
  </Link>
  { articleOptions }
</div>
```

Note `getArticles()` is passed to the `handleArticleDelete()` function, we'll discuss that next.

### Home.js

The `<Home/>` component is rendered based on App's routes and acts as a landing page for the application. The page contains a list of all articles on the site.

_Home.js_ makes a get request for the entire _articles collection_ in the database and simply renders them using a map function on the `<Article/>` component, a sort of template for previewing an article's data.

Note however, that this operation is held in a seperate function `getArticles()`.

This is used as a means to trigger re-renders on list of `<Article/>` components when, specifically, a delete operation is carried out.

The `getArticles()` function is passed to every `<Article/>` to implement this.

```javascript
getArticles() {
  axios.get('/api/home')
    .then(response => this.setState({ articles: response.data }));
}

render() {
  const { articles } = this.state;
  const articlesList = articles.map(a => (
    <Article
      id={a._id}
      userId={a.user_id}
      getArticles={this.getArticles}
      // ...
    />
  ));
  // ...
}
```

The `getArticles()` function is seen above as passed to the `<Provider/>` component from `<Article/>` and called from there:

```javascript
<IconButton onClick={() => context.handleArticleDelete(id, getArticles)} />
```

### Profile.js

The `<Profile/>` component serves the same function as `<Home/>` but with a slight difference.

_Profile.js_ is for authenticated users only. It makes a request to `/api/profile` and uses passport to authenitcate the user using cookies and JWT.

If the user is not logged in, then react router's redirect component is rendered:

```Javascript
getArticles() {
  axios.get('/api/profile')
    .then((response) => {})
    .catch(() => this.setState({ redirect: true }));
}
// ...
{ redirect && <Redirect to="/Signin" /> }
```

### Publish.js

The function of the `<Publish/>` component is to render a form for creating a new article, or, populate the form with an existing article for editing.

This is achieved through react router optional parametres and conditional rendering.

```javascript
// App.js
<Route path="/publish/:id?" render={props => <Publish {...props} />} />
```

When a user clicks on an `<article/>` edit operation, it links to the `<Publish/>` component with a URL parametre holding it's id. A get request for the article is made and the form is populated with response data.

When a user clicks on a new article operation, it links to `<Publish/>` with no id. A get request fails and the form is left blank.

However, both operations require a different express route. This is decided by the `.catch()` function in Axios:

```javascript
// If an article is found, populate the form + set update true
componentDidMount() {
  const { match } = this.props;
  axios.get(`/api/article/${match.params.id}`)
    .then((response) => {
      this.setState({
        // ...
        update: true,
      });
    })
    .catch(() => this.setState({ update: false }));
}
```

Then depending on the `update` state proprety, a URL is chosen:

```javascript
let url;
if (update) {
  url = `/api/article/${match.params.id}`;
} else {
  url = `/api/user/${globalUserId}/article`;
}
axios.post(url, {...})
```

### Signup.js + Signin.js

The functions of both `<Signup/>` and `<Signin/>` are alligned closelly, one being built of the other.

They hold a state for all relevant credentials and matching error fields built into _MDC._

They make post requests to the server for regular validation, Passport authentication, and Mongoose schema validation.

If there are any errors, appropriate response data is sent back to the client and is rendered accordingly via a switch statement in the user interface.

If the requests evaluate to valid, react router's `<Redirect/>` component is again utilised.

Pseudo code for both classes:

```javascript
class Signup extends Component {

  constructor() {
    this.state = {
      username: '',
      usernameError: '',
      // ...
      redirect: false,
    };
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const { username } = this.state;
    // Make POST Request ðŸ“®
    axios.post('api/signup', {...})
      .then((response) => {
        if (response.status === 200) this.setState({ redirect: true });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // Validate ðŸ”’
        switch (error.response.data) {
          case 'Missing credentials':
            this.setState({
              usernameError: error.response.data,
            });
            break;
        }
      });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        { redirect && <Redirect to="/Signin" /> }
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit} />
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }

}
```

# Server

Briefly, the server is comprised of three parts.

The `models` folder contains mongoose schema which maps data to our _MongoDB collections._ They define the shape of documents within a collection via the rules and methods we create.

`Passport.js` conatins what are known as _strategies._ The two strategies used are the `local` and `jwt` strategies.

The `local` strategy is invoked on a _sign in_ operation. It requires a username and password for authenticating the existence of a user. If successful, a new user session is initialised in the form of a signed `jwt`.

```javascript
passport.use(new LocalStrategy((username, password, done) => {
  User.findOne({ username }, (err, user) => {...});
}));
```

The `jwt` strategy is invoked when a user attempts to access a locked portion of the application. It uses a set of `opts` to extract a cookie from the browser and check to see if it matches an existing signed user token.

```javascript
const opts = {};
opts.jwtFromRequest = ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken();
opts.secretOrKey = process.env.SECRET;

passport.use(new JwtStrategy(opts, (jwtPayload, done) => {
  User.findOne({ username: jwtPayload }, (err, user) => {...});
}));
```

Both of these strategies are invoked via `server.js` when a request is made to an API endpoint. The request is wrapped around a custom Passport callback which carries out the passport tasks.

e.g:

```javascript
server.get('/api/profile', (req, res, next) => {
  req.headers.authorization = `Bearer ${req.cookies.token}`;
  passport.authenticate('jwt', (err, user) => {...})(req, res, next);
});
```

Lastly, the `server.js` contains our connection to the database:

```javascript
const dbURI = `mongodb+srv://${process.env.USER}:${process.env.PASS}@${process.env.HOST}`;

mongoose.connect(dbURI, { useNewUrlParser: true }, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  } else {
    server.listen(...);
  }
});
```

Middleware for our Express requests, like `bodyParser` so Json is accessible, `cookieParser` for easy access via `req.cookie`, and `express-session` and `passport` for use with authentication:

```javascript
server.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
server.use(bodyParser.json());
server.use(cookieParser());
server.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SECRET,
  store: new MongoStore({ mongooseConnection: mongoose.connection }),
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
}));
server.use(passport.initialize());
server.use(passport.session());
```

The rest are express routes for our React application. Each route has a specific URL whereby Axios can send a request to.

Each route uses our middleware to extract data, use our passports and use Mongooes to save data to our database. When complete, express will return a respones to the client.

e.g:

```javascript
server.delete('/api/article/:id', (req, res) => {
  Article.deleteOne({ _id: new ObjectID(req.params.id) }, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    res.status(200).send('Successfully deleted');
  });
});
```

# Reflection

This project was a mixed bag for me. I very much enjoy React as a framework with it's lego-like approach to building applications. However, with the introduction of the server-side content I didn't feel confident.

Atlas, MongoDB, Mongoose, Axios and React Router all came very quick to me I think, but I made the mistake of trying to integrate Passport into my project.

The problem I faced was that I really didn't know as much as I thought I did about browsers. That is to say, I spend my life in the console, yet I've never even thought to look at the _application_ tab or _network_ tab or even consider what HTTP was doing.

I struggled to understand what exactly I was telling the browser to do. I understand routes, or middleware, but what a cookie actually is, where it's stored, how to access it, how to debug it etc, was challenging.

It's a simple hurdle I'd assume, but networks was never my strong suit and trying to pick up passport took a heap of my time.

I didn't for example get all the data I wanted into the application, or UI elements like search bars. On top of this I tried React's Context which is great. It took me a while but I enjoyed it.

Between trying new React concepts and re-evaluating my understand of HTTP, I lost a lot of time, but again, this project isn't about design.

Lastly, Webpack was a nightmare for a while. I understand what it does, but the syntax always got me and I struggled to juggle thinking about how all the different add-ons were packaging things together, but that's documentation I suppose. MDC's resources helped a lot but I still found myself on Stack Overflow often enough.

Overall, I feel I have somewhat improved, especially in contrast to my last two applications.
